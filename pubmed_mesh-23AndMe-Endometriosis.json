A genome-wide association study meta-analysis, including 60,674 cases and 701,926 controls of European and East Asian descent, identified 42 genome-wide significant loci comprising 49 distinct association signals. Effect sizes were largest for stage 3\/4 disease, driven by ovarian endometriosis. Identified signals explained up to 5.01% of disease variance and regulated expression or methylation of genes in endometrium and blood, many of which were associated with pain perception\/maintenance (SRP14\/BMF, GDAP1, MLLT10, BSN and NGF). We observed significant genetic correlations between endometriosis and 11 pain conditions, including migraine, back and multisite chronic pain (MCP), as well as inflammatory conditions, including asthma and osteoarthritis. Multitrait genetic analyses identified substantial sharing of variants associated with endometriosis and MCP\/migraine. Targeted investigations of genetically regulated mechanisms shared between endometriosis and other pain conditions are needed to aid the development of new treatments and facilitate early symptomatic intervention.","mesh_heading_texts":["Endometriosis"]},{"paper_id":"36130970","DOI":"10.1038\/s41467-022-33222-y","Title":"Author Correction: Genome-wide association and epidemiological analyses reveal common genetic origins between uterine leiomyomata and endometriosis.","Abstract":"","mesh_heading_texts":[]},{"paper_id":"35472084","DOI":"10.1093\/humrep\/deab254","Title":"Genetic overlap analysis of endometriosis and asthma identifies shared loci implicating sex hormones and thyroid signalling pathways.","Abstract":"National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia (241,944, 339,462, 389,927, 389,875, 389,891, 389,892, 389,938, 443,036, 442,915, 442,981, 496,610, 496,739, 552,485, 552,498, 1,026,033 and 1,050,208), Wellcome Trust (awards 076113 and 085475) and the Lundbeck Foundation (R102-A9118 and R155-2014-1724).
