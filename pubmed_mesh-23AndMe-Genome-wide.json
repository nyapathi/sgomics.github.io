Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple risk variants for depression, due to the complicated gene regulatory mechanisms and complexity of linkage disequilibrium (LD), the biological mechanisms by which the risk variants exert their effects on depression remain largely unknown. Here, we perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of depression by integrating GWAS summary statistics from 807,553 individuals (246,363 depression cases and 561,190 controls) and summary-level gene-expression data (from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 1003 individuals). We identified 53 transcriptome-wide significant (TWS) risk genes for depression, of which 23 genes were not implicated in risk loci of the original GWAS. Seven out of 53 risk genes (B3GALTL, FADS1, TCTEX1D1, XPNPEP3, ZMAT2, ZNF501 and ZNF502) showed TWS associations with depression in two independent brain expression quantitative loci (eQTL) datasets, suggesting that these genes may represent promising candidates. We further conducted conditional analyses and identified the potential risk genes that driven the TWAS association signal in each locus. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis revealed biologically pathways relevant to depression. Our study identified new depression risk genes whose expression dysregulation may play a role in depression. More importantly, we translated the GWAS associations into risk genes and relevant pathways. Further mechanistic study and functional characterization of the TWS depression risk genes will facilitate the diagnostics and therapeutics for depression.","mesh_heading_texts":["Genome-Wide Association Study","Transcriptome"]},{"paper_id":"33888908","DOI":"10.1038\/s41588-021-00846-7","Title":"Genetic analyses identify widespread sex-differential participation bias.","Abstract":"Genetic association results are often interpreted with the assumption that study participation does not affect downstream analyses.

For each individual, we identified the earliest age at which asthma, hay fever and\/or eczema was first diagnosed and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of this combined age-of-onset phenotype.

An outstanding question in the field is what other genetic factors that influence GBA-associated risk for disease, and whether these overlap with known Parkinson's disease risk variants. Using multiple, large case-control datasets, totalling 217 165 individuals (22 757 Parkinson's disease cases, 13 431 Parkinson's disease proxy cases, 622 Lewy body dementia cases and 180 355 controls), we identified 1691 Parkinson's disease cases, 81 Lewy body dementia cases, 711 proxy cases and 7624 controls with a GBA variant (p.E326K, p.T369M or p.N370S). We performed a genome-wide association study and analysed the most recent Parkinson's disease-associated genetic risk score to detect genetic influences on GBA risk and age at onset. We attempted to replicate our findings in two independent datasets, including the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc. and whole-genome sequencing data. Our analysis showed that the overall Parkinson's disease genetic risk score modifies risk for disease and decreases age at onset in carriers of GBA variants. Notably, this effect was consistent across all tested GBA risk variants. Dissecting this signal demonstrated that variants in close proximity to SNCA and CTSB (encoding cathepsin B) are the most significant contributors. Risk variants in the CTSB locus were identified to decrease mRNA expression of CTSB. Additional analyses suggest a possible genetic interaction between GBA and CTSB and GBA p.N370S induced pluripotent cell-derived neurons were shown to have decreased cathepsin B expression compared to controls. These data provide a genetic basis for modification of GBA-associated Parkinson's disease risk and age at onset, although the total contribution of common genetics variants is not large. We further demonstrate that common variability at genes implicated in lysosomal function exerts the largest effect on GBA associated risk for disease. Further, these results have implications for selection of GBA carriers for therapeutic interventions.","mesh_heading_texts":["genetics","genetics","genetics","genetics","Penetrance","genetics"]},{"paper_id":"31701892","DOI":"10.1016\/S1474-4422(19)30320-5","Title":"Identification of novel risk loci, causal insights, and heritable risk for Parkinson's disease: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.","Abstract":"The National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health (USA), The Michael J Fox Foundation, and The Parkinson's Foundation (see appendix for full list of funding sources).","mesh_heading_texts":["Databases, Genetic","genetics","genetics","methods","genetics"]},{"paper_id":"31659794","DOI":"10.1002\/mds.27873","Title":"The Parkinson's Disease Mendelian Randomization Research Portal.","Abstract":"We present a new platform which offers Mendelian randomization analyses for a total of 5,839 genome-wide association studies versus the largest PD genome-wide association studies available (https:\/\/pdgenetics.shinyapps.io\/MRportal\/).

We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Only one locus differed significantly in its association by diagnostic criteria; otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or non-NIH Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis revealed genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. The data thus demonstrate 3 novel loci associated with PCOS and similar genetic architecture for all diagnostic criteria. The data also provide the first genetic evidence for a male phenotype for PCOS and a causal link to depression, a previously hypothesized comorbid disease.

DNA samples from 17 Finnish mothers who delivered at least one infant preterm were subjected to whole exome sequencing. All mothers were of northern Finnish origin and were from seven multiplex families. Additional replication samples of European origin consisted of 93 Danish sister pairs (and two sister triads), all with a history of a preterm delivery. Rare exonic variants (frequency <1%) were analyzed to identify genes and pathways likely to affect SPTB susceptibility. We identified rare, possibly damaging, variants in genes that were common to multiple affected individuals. The glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway was the most significant (p<1.7e-8) with genes containing these variants in a subgroup of ten Finnish mothers, each having had 2-4 SPTBs. This pathway was replicated among the Danish sister pairs. A gene in this pathway, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1 like (HSPA1L), contains two likely damaging missense alleles that were found in four different Finnish families. One of the variants (rs34620296) had a higher frequency in cases compared to controls (0.0025 vs. 0.0010, p = 0.002) in a large preterm birth genome-wide association study (GWAS) consisting of mothers of general European ancestry. Sister pairs in replication samples also shared rare, likely damaging HSPA1L variants. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted an additional phosphorylation site generated by rs34620296 that could potentially affect chaperone activity or HSPA1L protein stability. Finally, in vitro functional experiment showed a link between HSPA1L activity and decidualization. In conclusion, rare, likely damaging, variants in HSPA1L were observed in multiple families with recurrent SPTB.","mesh_heading_texts":["Genetic Predisposition to Disease","genetics","genetics"]},{"paper_id":"29942085","DOI":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0151-7","Title":"Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for neuroticism in 449,484 individuals identifies novel genetic loci and pathways.","Abstract":"Neuroticism is an important risk factor for psychiatric traits, including depression","mesh_heading_texts":["Genetic Loci","Genetic Predisposition to Disease","methods","physiology"]},{"paper_id":"29808027","DOI":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0127-7","Title":"Genome-wide association meta-analysis highlights light-induced signaling as a driver for refractive error.","Abstract":"Refractive errors, including myopia, are the most frequent eye disorders worldwide and an increasingly common cause of blindness.

Expression experiments and comprehensive in silico analyses identified retinal cell physiology and light processing as prominent mechanisms, and also identified functional contributions to refractive-error development in all cell types of the neurosensory retina, retinal pigment epithelium, vascular endothelium and extracellular matrix. Newly identified genes implicate novel mechanisms such as rod-and-cone bipolar synaptic neurotransmission, anterior-segment morphology and angiogenesis. Thirty-one loci resided in or near regions transcribing small RNAs, thus suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation.

Most association studies of 2D:4D ratio with a diverse range of sex-specific traits have typically involved small sample sizes and have been difficult to replicate, raising questions around the utility and precise meaning of the measure. In the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of 2D:4D ratio to date (N\u2009=\u200915\u00a0661, with replication N\u2009=\u200975\u00a0821), we identified 11 loci (9 novel) explaining 3.8% of the variance in mean 2D:4D ratio.

Furthermore, genetic variants associated with (adult) testosterone levels and\/or sex hormone-binding globulin were not associated with 2D:4D ratio in our sample. Although we were unable to find strong evidence from our genetic study to support the hypothesis that 2D:4D ratio is a direct biomarker of prenatal exposure to androgens in healthy individuals, our findings do not explicitly exclude this possibility, and pathways involving testosterone may become apparent as the size of the discovery sample increases further.
